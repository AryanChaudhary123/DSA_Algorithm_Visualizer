# Conceptualization of linear data structures and sorting algorithms through visualization

An interactive tool for real-time visualization of sorting algorithms, linked lists, stacks, queues, and arrays. Built using C++, OpenGL, and Dear ImGui, this project aims to make learning data structures and algorithms easier and more engaging through intuitive animations and user interaction.

# Features


Data Structure Visualization

Arrays: Perform and visualize operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal.

Linked Lists: Explore singly and doubly linked lists with animated operations.

Stacks: Visualize push and pop operations with real-time updates.

Queues: Animate enqueue and dequeue operations.

# Sorting Algorithms


Step-by-step visualizations of sorting algorithms:

Bubble Sort

Selection Sort

Insertion Sort

Quick Sort

Merge Sort

# Interactive GUI


Built with Dear ImGui for smooth and user-friendly controls.

Users can input data, select operations, and view real-time animations.

Real-Time Feedback

Immediate visualization of operations to enhance understanding.

# Technologies Used

C++: Core programming language for implementing the application logic.

OpenGL: For rendering graphical animations.

Dear ImGui: To create an intuitive and interactive graphical user interface.
